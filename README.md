# Seattle Makers 3D Printer profiles for PrusaSlicer
---
These are the PrusaSlicer profiles for the printers at Seattle Makers. They are provided here so you are able to slice at home, and get an idea of print time and material usage. Feel free to play with the settings on your machine, but the *g-code sent to the printers must be sliced by a makeeter or certified member.*
